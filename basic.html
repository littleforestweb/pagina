        little help from Little Forest.
        We have been working with Experian for years and are always excited when they come to us with new projects.
        They have a wealth of information stored up and it was exciting to think of the best ways in which to make this
        data beneficial to their customers.
        Let’s take a look at the finished result. Based on the postcode you input the dashboard will work out the
        average disposable income.
        Please note – we do not recommend buying 954 jam doughnuts!</p>
    <p>We are happy to announce that LFi is now successfully integrated with Qualtrics for Net Promoter Score (NPS) and
        our users are loving it!

        With Qualtrics steadily becoming one of the most popular online survey collaboration platforms, we weren’t
        surprised when we were asked by our clients to introduce Qualtrics to their LFi reporting platform.

        LFi now allows multi-nationals to analyse and compare insight’s from Qualtrics NPS across all their national
        sites. This way they know which countries are getting the the best feedback and how they can improve on the
        lower scoring sites.

        The graph below shows total monthly average NPS score across all markets.</p>
    <p>As a huge multinational company with multiple sites and thousands of pages knowing where to start can be daunting
        but that’s where LFi comes in. We worked with our client to find out their needs, customise the visualisation
        and support them once the system went live. It’s definitely a digital success story worth reading.

        Month on month we saw improvements in the score and worked with them to upgrade their tools features. But it was
        through their own hard work which achieved going from a low 52 to an incredible 73 in less than a year.

        But this isn’t just about a score, by drilling down into their LFi results, we are able to see how maintaining
        the quality of the web site had huge increase in Organic traffic- read on to see how.</p>
    <p>Experian Fraud Dashboard – The Project
        Experian are the leading global information services company, providing data and analytical tools to their
        clients around the world. They help businesses to manage credit risk, prevent fraud, target marketing offers and
        automate decision making.

        The Brief
        Experian approached Little Forest with the challenge of creating a visually exciting and data rich dashboard to
        communicate the latest statistics on Fraud in the UK.

        The Solution
        Little Forest worked closely with Experian and helped them create their vision of the Fraud Dashboard in a
        project of just a few short weeks.

        We created an interactive dashboard that works beautifully on all devices and quickly shows the customer the
        most important information in the Fraud space at a glance.

        Below is a screenshot of part of the dashboard – you can see the full project on the Experian UK website at
        http://www.experian.co.uk/identity-and-fraud/fraud-statistics/.</p>
    <p>Project Description
        ICS (International Card Services) has been established in the credit card business for over 25 years. With more
        than 3 million customers, ICS is one of the ten largest credit card issuers in Europe and is the market leader
        in the Netherlands.

        The Brief
        The client approached Little Forest with 3 primary needs;

        Upgrade their TeamSite platform

        Implement a solution to improve the duplication and overhead in managing the content in their banking
        applications

        To build a robust content preview for transactional content

        The Solution
        Little Forest set to work in doing a full Health Check to confirm the client’s environment. With this
        information we created a high level plan for the work ahead.

        The Outcome
        Phase 1 – Upgrading TeamSite to the latest version. One of the requirements from the client was a fully
        automated build of their TeamSite server environment. Due to the nature of their highly secure environment,
        Little Forest simply provided installation scripts for all upgrade code. This meant we never had to access the
        locked down banking environment and made the project run much faster. The process also provided a reliable
        method to move from development, to test and production servers in a repeatable manner.

        Phase 2 – Relying on our many TeamSite engagements in the past, we designed a much improved way to edit the
        content that supported their financial applications.Our solution was win-win by making the process easier and
        more efficient we simplified the user experience while making the IT Support Team’s job easier!

        Phase 3 – Due to a complex and highly regulated banking environment, our client required a robust content
        preview solution. The solution had to ensure that a Content Editor could be very confident that their content
        change was 100% correct. Little Forest engineered a solution which overcame the numerous complexities of
        integration and met the client’s needs precisely. As a result Content Editors are much more productive in their
        day to day work improving improving their own customers experience online. </p>
    <p>Project Description
        British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom, based in Waterside, near its main hub at
        London Heathrow Airport.

        It is the largest airline in the UK based on fleet size, international flights and international destinations
        and second largest measured by passengers carried.

        The Brief
        British Airways first met Little Forest when their Content Management System (CMS) was over 10 years old. The
        system was no longer able to cope with their increasingly complex demands of their web platform.

        They wanted to take advantage of the latest technology to drive sales and customer satisfaction on ba.com. In
        particular British Airways wanted to improve their Search Engine Ranking as well as their multi-language
        capability.

        British Airways also wanted to create and promote a microsite for Las Vegas. This will make it easier for the
        customers who want to go on a trip to that city.

        The Solution
        Little Forest worked closely with British Airways and helped them upgrade to the latest version of the Autonomy
        platform. We replaced their old Solaris with the newer and most cost-friendly Linux.

        Little Forest trained all of the business and technical users in understanding all the new and advanced features
        of the platform.

        We advised on the Best Practices in terms of complex technical integration and architectures relevant to
        Autonomy. Little Forest helped to design all of the key cornerstones of the new platform and gave our expert
        recommendations on each aspect of the solution.

        For the Las Vegas microsite, we have provided guidance on the high level design and low level implementation
        details.

        The Outcome
        British Airways have been updated to the latest Autonomy web platform. They have launched a pilot project on the
        new solution and are rapidly rolling out all other areas of ba.com onto the system.

        The users are able to offer far more engaging and relevant content to their customers far quicker and with
        higher quality than ever before.</p>

        1,700 stores across Europe.

        It is based in the United Kingdom and owns 50% of CPW Europe, a joint venture with Best Buy which includes all
        Carphone Warehouse stores.

        Outside Ireland and the United Kingdom, the company trades as Phone House.

        The Brief
        Carphone approached Little Forest to dramatically improve their TeamSite content management system. There were
        several issues affecting the overall productivity of the team.

        The desire was to improve reliability and the performance of the system as a whole.

        The Solution
        Little Forest conducted a review of the implementation and created a series of recommendations to achieve the
        desired productivity increase. Over a two month period the CMS was upgraded to the latest version including
        several new usability and performance benefits.

        Key points of the custom solution were also re-written to follow a best practice approach.

        The Outcome
        The new CMS platform was launched to great success and welcomed from the user base. In addition to the new
        features was increased reliability and the system no longer crashed under heavy load.

        The key customisation improved in performance from a 60 second load time to a 2 second load time, thus enabling
        for greater throughput of content form the team.</p>

        to improve their CMS performance as it’s out-of-date.

        The Solution
        Little Forest helped developed Tesco Baby Club’s website and improve its CMS performance by upgrading it to the
        latest version.

        Little Forest trained all of the business and technical users in understanding all the new and advanced features
        of the improved platform.

    <p>Project Description
        Virgin Media provides fixed and mobile telephone, television and broadband internet services to businesses and
        consumers in the United Kingdom.

        Its executive office is in New York City, United States and its operational headquarters are in Hook, UK.

        The company was formed in March 2006 by the merger of NTL and Telewest, which created NTL:Telewest.

        A further merger with Virgin Mobile UK in July 2006 created the first “quadruple-play” media company in the
        United Kingdom, offering television, internet, mobile phone and fixed-line telephone services.

        All of the company’s consumer services were rebranded under the Virgin Media name in February 2007.

        The Brief
        Virgin Mobile approached Little Forest requesting advice on how to improve the usability and quality of their
        TeamSite Content Management System (CMS).

        The platform needed modernisation and an end to the on-going support issues hampering the ability of the web
        team in keeping their website useful and engaging for their customers.

        The Solution
        Little Forest went to work and upgraded the Virgin platform to the latest version of TeamSite and OpenDeploy. We
        identified the key parts of the user journey and enhanced these in terms of usability and speed of completion
        for the user.

        Our expert consultants quickly discovered the root cause of the stability issues and fixed these. The deployment
        of content to the website was re-written as it was frequently crashing the whole web platform.

        Little Forest performed in depth training for both business and technical users.

        The Outcome
        Virgin Mobile once again has a stable, user friendly and performant CMS. The website no longer crashes when
        content is deployed. The users are empowered and productive. Little Forest is working together with Virgin on
        further modernisations so their business can take advantage of the latest web technology.</p>
