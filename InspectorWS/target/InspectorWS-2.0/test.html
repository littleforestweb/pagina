        <p>Our LFi platform provides high level customised Web Governance reports which allow for lightning speed

        <p>We are happy to announce that LFi is now successfully integrated with Qualtrics for Net Promoter Score (NPS)
            and our users are loving it! With Qualtrics steadily becoming one of the most popular online survey
            collaboration platforms, we weren’t surprised when we were asked by our clients to introduce Qualtrics to
            their LFi reporting platform. LFi now allows multi-nationals to analyse and compare insight’s from Qualtrics
            NPS across all their national sites. This way they know which countries are getting the the best feedback
            and how they can improve on the lower scoring sites. The graph below shows total monthly average NPS score
            across all markets.</p>
        <p>As a huge multinational company with multiple sites and thousands of pages knowing where to start can be
            daunting but that’s where LFi comes in. We worked with our client to find out their needs, customise the
            visualisation and support them once the system went live. It’s definitely a digital success story worth
            reading. Month on month we saw improvements in the score and worked with them to upgrade their tools
            features. But it was through their own hard work which achieved going from a low 52 to an incredible 73 in
            less than a year. But this isn’t just about a score, by drilling down into their LFi results, we are able to
            see how maintaining the quality of the web site had huge increase in Organic traffic- read on to see how.
